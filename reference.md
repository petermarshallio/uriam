# Spiral — Reference

Strict definitions and lookup tables. No narrative, no metaphor beyond what's needed to define a term. For the full explanation of why any of this works, see [`about.md`](./about.md). For the framework's history, see [`origin.md`](./origin.md).

Two tiers below. **Core Concepts** are facts — what a term *is*, no rationale attached. **Usage** is how each concept gets *applied* — techniques, decision criteria, comparisons. Core Concepts are foundational enough that `about.md` echoes them (in prose, or as a table where prose can't substitute); Usage material is never duplicated there — `about.md` only links to it.

---

## Core Concepts

- **Internal / External** — not a property of a medium or a body part, but of whose current state is the source or target of an act, relative to whichever Actor is the subject of the spiral in question. A store counts as internal to an Actor if it's part of that Actor's own persistent state — memory, understanding, model weights — regardless of whether the Actor is human or a mechanism, and regardless of whether anything resembling human comprehension occurs. A sensor's reading sitting in a file nobody consults is external-to-external; the same reading entering a system's own long-term memory is external-to-internal, for that system, because the memory is genuinely its interior.
- **Internalising** — External source → internal target. Something outside becomes part of what you know.
- **Examining** — Internal source → internal target. Working on what you already have; nothing new enters, nothing yet leaves.
- **Externalising** — Internal source → external target. Internal reasoning made legible to someone or something outside yourself.
- **Interacting** — External source → external target. Acting on the world; the world responds; something new exists that didn't before.
- **The Matrix** — The 2×2 grid of source (where input comes from) × target (where output goes) that the four stages derive from.
- **Actor** — A person or an AI system: whatever is capable of being assigned to a Role (from ArchiMate's Business Actor).
- **Role** — A behavioural responsibility, not a person: Hero, Stage Manager, Dramaturg, Director, Witness, Critic. One Actor can be assigned several Roles, including more than one within a single exchange (from ArchiMate's Business Role).
- **The Cast** — The four characters, one per stage: the Dramaturg (Examining), the Director (Externalising), the Witness (Interacting), the Critic (Internalising) — each acting as a coach to the Hero, not an advisor: draws out what the Hero already has rather than supplying an answer. Three coach action; the fourth, uniquely, coaches restraint.
- **The Dramaturg** — Owns Examining. Turns what Internalising gathered into an actual idea by interrogating it, not waiting for it to arrive.
- **The Director** — Owns Externalising. Turns an idea into a take specific enough to be wrong.
- **The Witness** — Owns Interacting. Doesn't turn anything into anything — watches what the world does with the take, and holds off reaching back in until there's real signal.
- **The Critic** — Owns Internalising. Turns the verdict on what happened during Interacting into material for next time.
- **The Stage Manager** — The fifth Role, owning no content, only the process. Three concrete jobs: generating candidate cues (proposing what a crossing could look like, without unilateral authority to call it), hosting the Interaction where a cue actually gets decided (Notes), and self-declaring whichever Role's work is in progress so every Actor involved can track where things stand. Can act mid-stage, not only at a fixed cue, when momentum is under threat. A facilitator, in the formal sense: owns the process, not the content — and never the sole Approver; see "Decision Rights at a Cue (DACI)" below.
- **Cue** — The fixed crossing point between one stage and the next. Four per cycle, named Separate, Elect, Enable, and Sense.
- **Notes** — What happens at a cue: a check of what's understood against what's needed, before the Hero moves on. Quiet by default; a full multi-voice version exists ("Convening the cast for review" in the skill file — see "Usage," below, for when it earns its cost).
- **Collaboration** — The set of Actors currently assigned to Roles for a given cycle (from ArchiMate's Business Collaboration: two or more roles working together).
- **Interaction** — A full cycle, start to finish, performed jointly by a Collaboration (from ArchiMate's Business Interaction: the collective behaviour a Collaboration performs). Every cue's Notes is a smaller Interaction nested inside it — the Fractal Property, one level down.
- **Ceremony** — Informal name for an Interaction in progress. Unlike Scrum's ceremonies, never schedule-bound: a Spiral Ceremony convenes when the work is ready, not on a clock.
- **Hero** — The Role of doing the work and crossing the cues. Assigned to whichever Actor — a person, or an AI — is doing it right now.
- **Velocity** — The raw rate at which an Actor moves through transitions. Says nothing about which ones — churn and genuine progress both register.
- **Continuity** — A transition preserves Continuity when the completing stage's target and the next stage's source share the same type (Internal→Internal, External→External) — what was produced is genuinely what the next stage draws on, not swapped for something else mid-transit.
- **Momentum** — Velocity counted only across transitions that preserve Continuity and don't return to the same stage: the rate of genuine progress round the cycle, not just activity. High: each revolution lands somewhere new. False: high Velocity that isn't Momentum — activity that breaks Continuity or returns to the same stage, without advancing.
- **Stagnation** — Zero Momentum from returning to the same stage: the same stage recurring, regardless of how much Velocity is spent inside it.
- **Home box** — The stage someone gravitates toward, where they spend disproportionate time.
- **Neglected character** — The cast member someone most often avoids meeting.
- **The Fractal Property** — Every stage is itself a full Spiral cycle; the framework applies recursively at any granularity, cues included.
- **Reach levels** — The scope of knowledge in play at any stage: World, Enterprise, Division, Team, Self.
- **Code-switching** — Deliberately changing register (Dramaturg/Director/Witness/Critic) to fit context, while one continuous self persists underneath doing the switching.

### Techniques Each Character Draws On

Each character's job description is deliberately abstract — "turn the idea into a take specific enough to be wrong" has to mean something different for a personal decision than for a software spec. Rather than pick one universal technique per character (tried, and broke immediately on Spiral's own README example: "As a traveler, I want to visit Geneva" is not a real articulation technique), each character has a menu of established, named, well-documented methods to draw from — pick whichever one's actual domain matches the situation. The specific reference matters: it's what lets both the skill and the model agree on exactly what a name denotes, rather than a vague gesture at "be more rigorous." See `SKILL.md` for when it's appropriate to name one of these out loud versus translate it into plain language.

#### The Critic (Internalising)

| Method | Specific reference | Fits because |
| --- | --- | --- |
| After-Action Review | US Army's 4-question format (expected/actual/why/next) | Converts an outcome's verdict into reusable knowledge |

#### The Dramaturg (Examining)

| Method | Specific reference | Fits because |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Socratic Method | Platonic elenchus (self-questioning to test a claim) | Interrogates a claim already held, unexamined |
| Dialectical Reasoning | Hegelian thesis-antithesis-synthesis triad | Reconciles opposing ideas already in mind |
| First Principles Thinking | Cartesian/Aristotelian decomposition to fundamentals | Strips a concept down, rebuilds from scratch |
| Six Thinking Hats | De Bono's six sequential lenses | Forces six angles onto the same material |
| Second-Order Thinking | Munger's latticework of mental models | Traces downstream consequences of an existing idea |

| Double-Loop Learning | Argyris & Schön's governing-variables model | Questions whether the goal itself was right, not just what happened |
| 5 Whys | Toyota Production System root-cause technique | Chases a symptom back to its actual cause |

#### The Director (Externalising)

| Method | Specific reference | Fits because |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SMART Goals | Doran's 1981 Specific/Measurable/Achievable/Relevant/Time-bound | Makes intent checkable, not just aspirational |
| User Stories + Acceptance Criteria | Mike Cohn's Agile format | Frames a need as testable, falsifiable intent |
| PRD | Standard product-requirements-document format | Commits problem and requirements before building starts |
| RFC / ADR | Nygard's Context-Decision-Consequences template | Records a decision's reasoning so it's challengeable |

| Pre-mortem | Gary Klein's 2007 HBR "Project Premortem" | Imagines failure before it happens, and writes the mitigation into the plan |
| Definition of Done | Scrum Guide's completion-criteria artifact | Commits, in writing, what "actually finished" will mean |

#### The Witness (Interacting)

| Method | Specific reference | Fits because |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PDCA's "Do" phase | Deming/Toyota Plan-Do-Check-Act cycle | The plan meets real-scale resistance; nothing left to do but watch whether it holds |
| Chaos Engineering | Netflix's Principles of Chaos Engineering | Exposes a live system to injected failure and watches how it actually responds — the fault is triggered once, everything after is observation |
| Canary Deployment / A-B Testing | Progressive-delivery and controlled-experiment practice | Releases a change into real traffic and reads the world's actual response before anyone decides what to do about it |
| Observability (SRE practice) | Dashboards and monitoring built to watch a live system without touching it | Lets the world's actual state be seen in real time, with zero requirement to act until there's real signal — the interrupt-driven version of watching, not the anxious-polling one |

None of these are mandatory and none is "the" technique for a character — they're a vocabulary of well-trodden, nameable patterns to reach for instead of reasoning from a vague personality trait.

### Testing Whether an Act Belongs to a Quadrant

A word can sound like it belongs to a quadrant because it's culturally associated with that territory, not because it passes the matrix's own source/target logic. Five checks, run in order, catch most misclassifications:

1. **Source test.** Does the act require the Actor's own *current* internal state — an idea, a feeling, a plan held right now — as its origin? If yes, internal source. If the act operates on something already external to the Actor (an artifact, a system, another Actor's output) regardless of anyone's current internal state, external source.
2. **Target test.** Does the effect land in comprehension (the Actor's own, or another's) or as an observable change in the world? Comprehension is an internal target; an observable change — an object, an event, a system state — is an external target.
3. **Fractal trap.** Does the candidate word, in ordinary use, already name a whole role or process that itself cycles through all four stages (planning, marketing, parenting, coaching)? If so, it names a cycle, not a quadrant — exclude it rather than force it into one box.
4. **Whose-spiral test.** If the act appears to depend on what happens inside another Actor's head — their opinion, their choice, their understanding — that event belongs to their spiral, not the Actor being classified. The act that actually belongs to the Actor being classified is only the external move that made the other Actor's event more likely, not the other Actor's internalising of it.
5. **Mechanism-blindness.** Which body part, tool, or medium carried out the act — hands, eyes, a keyboard, a server — is irrelevant to its classification (see SKILL.md's "A note on channel vs. direction"). Only the source and target of meaning matter.

Applied to this framework's own history: every name this framework has ever given its fourth stage — Do (1999), Creating (2011), Create (2026-06-29), Build (2026-07-02) — fails the source test the same way. Each requires the Actor's own current internal state (an intention, a design, a vision) as its origin, with the result landing externally. That is Internal → External, the same crossing as writing or speaking, just carried out with different tools — not External → External. The fourth quadrant had never had a name that actually described it, until Interacting (2026-07-09).

### The Phrase Test

The five tests above check whether an act's *direction* is correctly classified. They don't catch a different failure: a candidate word can point the right direction and still be the wrong choice, because of what it drags in connotatively or how awkwardly it sits in an actual sentence. A practical check for this: embed the candidate word in the exact self-referential sentence this framework would actually produce, and listen for whether it reads naturally or fights itself.

For a candidate Internalising-word, test: *"Before I internalise this, do I understand how it was [candidate word]-ed by others?"* For a candidate Externalising-word, test the mirror: *"Before I externalise this, do I understand how it will be [candidate word]-ed by others?"*

This single move catches two different failures at once. It exposes bad grammar fit — a word that doesn't take the passive "-ed by others" construction naturally usually isn't the right choice (this disqualified Precipitate for Interacting: "was this precipitated by others" is stilted, because precipitate wants an event as its object, not information, passed through it). And it exposes connotation a dictionary definition won't reveal — sometimes fatally (Synthesize drags "synthetic" into a sentence where authenticity was the entire point), sometimes in the candidate's favour (Propagate's adjacency to "propaganda" looks like a liability in isolation, but "was this propagated by others" is close to literally asking "was this propaganda?" — precisely the due-diligence question worth asking before internalising something).

### The Stage Manager — Who Plays the Role

This table describes who's *eligible* to hold the Role for a given flow type, not a fixed assignment for a whole exchange — within a single live AI ↔ Human exchange, the Role passes back and forth turn by turn (whoever proposes the next step, or reflects back what was just said, is holding it for that turn). See `about.md`'s "Facilitation can change hands" for the concrete case.

| Flow | Who plays the Stage Manager | Grounding |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Human, solo** | Internal executive function — the transition/initiation faculty, distinct from the content-generating faculty | Zimmerman's self-regulated learning cycle; Gollwitzer's implementation intentions; executive-function research on task-initiation (the well-documented gap between having an idea and acting on it) |
| **AI, solo** | Orchestrator logic — iteration budgets, reflection nodes, the state machine governing phase transitions | ReAct's missing Externalising step is this failure mode by another name: no governance of when Examining ends, so the loop thrashes or never converges |
| **AI → Human** | Neither side unilaterally — the call emerges from Notes, the joint check between them. The AI can generate candidate cues and self-declare its own stage; calling the cue for a human isn't its Role to hold alone | Horvitz's mixed-initiative interaction research; automation bias (deferring the cue-call to the AI even when it's wrong) is exactly the failure mode of skipping that joint check |
| **Human → Human** | A distinct, named role in the group — not the person doing the Internalising, Examining, Externalising, or Interacting | Scrum Master; meeting facilitator; chief of staff; the literal theatrical stage manager, who calls cues but never appears onstage |
| **AI → AI** | A supervisor/manager agent whose only output is whose turn it is and whether the phase is complete | Already shipped: LangGraph's supervisor pattern, AutoGen's `GroupChatManager`, CrewAI's hierarchical-process manager, MetaGPT's SOP-driven role router |

### Non-Linearity and Entry Points

| Entry point | Who does this | Risk |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Internalising first** | Researchers, readers, the cautious | Never meeting the Director |
| **Examining first** | Strategists, overthinkers | Thinking without sufficient raw material |
| **Externalising first** | Managers, executors | Articulating based on assumptions, not evidence |
| **Interacting first** | Builders, hackers, the impatient | Learning only from failure, expensively |

### Relation to Other Frameworks

| Framework | Internalising | Examining | Externalising | Interacting | What Spiral adds |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Bloom's Taxonomy** | Remember / Understand | Analyse / Evaluate | — | Create | The matrix; the cast; non-linearity |
| **Kolb's Cycle** | Concrete Experience | Reflective Observation | Abstract Conceptualisation | Active Experimentation | The cast; momentum; fractal property |
| **ReAct (AI agents)** | Observe | Think | — | Act | **Externalising** — the missing stage in most AI agents |
| **OODA Loop** | Observe | Orient | Decide | Act | Fractal property; momentum; home boxes |
| **Six Thinking Hats** | White Hat | Red/Black/Yellow | — | Green Hat | The matrix; the spiral structure; the Blue Hat is Six Thinking Hats' own Stage Manager, not an Externalising-analog — the same missing-Externalising gap ReAct has, just less visible |
| **Hermeneutic Circle** | — | The whole circle | — | — | Spiral externalises what the circle keeps internal |
| **Belbin Team Roles** | — | — | — | — | Independent validation for **the Stage Manager**: Belbin's Coordinator role was originally named "Chairman" before being renamed — the same correction, authority word to process word, that this framework just made |
| **Multi-agent orchestration** (AutoGen, CrewAI, LangGraph) | Retrieval / tool nodes | Worker-agent reasoning | Task routing | Worker-agent execution | Confirms **the Stage Manager** is buildable: supervisor/manager agents already do this exact job in production, without performing any Internalising/Examining/Externalising/Interacting work themselves |

### Applying Spiral to AI System Design

| Spiral stage | What an AI system does |
| --- | --- |
| **Internalising** | Corpus ingestion, retrieval, contextual grounding |
| **Examining** | Reasoning, chain-of-thought, multi-perspective critique |
| **Externalising** | Structured output, task decomposition, response framing |
| **Interacting** | Tool use, execution, an action changing a system already in production |

### Decision Rights at a Cue (DACI)

RACI is the wrong lens for who does what at a cue — its "Accountable" means answerable for the outcome, which sits awkwardly on a Stage Manager that explicitly owns no content. DACI fits because it separates authority to proceed from ownership of the work:

| DACI role | Who plays it | Why |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Driver** | The Hero | Owns getting the work done and actually crosses the cue |
| **Approver** | *Emergent from Notes* — the joint Interaction between whoever holds Hero and whoever holds Stage Manager, not either Role's unilateral call | Neither Actor has complete knowledge of the situation, their own or the other's, so the call to proceed is negotiated, not owned — the second DACI cell here that resists a single fixed owner, alongside Informed below |
| **Contributor** | The convened cast member(s) | Supply expertise and critique; never decide whether to move on |
| **Informed** | Whoever the output ultimately reaches | Doesn't map onto a single fixed Spiral role — a reader, a stalled human, a downstream teammate — it depends on the flow in play |

### Deciding When to Hold Full Notes

A full Notes session — the multi-voice mode described in `about.md`'s "The Cues," implemented as "Convening the cast for review" in the skill file — costs real tokens, real latency, and real attention. Most cues shouldn't pay for it. An agent implementing this framework needs an actual rule for when the expense is worth it, not "use your judgement":

| Signal | Favors quiet Notes (default) | Favors full Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Position in the fractal hierarchy** | An interior cue, inside a nested sub-cycle | A cue that closes the top-level cycle — the one whose output actually reaches the user or takes an action |
| **Cost of being wrong** | Cheap to redo — another Internalising pass, a discarded draft | Expensive or irreversible — commits to a claim that gets published, or an Interacting that changes external state |
| **Evidence quality** | The last stage's output is unambiguous — one clear reading | The evidence genuinely supports more than one defensible interpretation — thin corpus, conflicting sources, a close call |
| **Momentum history** | First time at this cue this cycle | The same cue has been crossed and re-crossed without real progress — a quiet call already failed once |
| **Explicit request** | Not asked for | Explicitly asked for ("convene the cast on that," "run a Spiral review") |

Default to quiet. Convening is the exception that earns its cost, not the baseline behaviour — the multi-agent orchestration frameworks above converged independently on lightweight supervisors precisely because full multi-voice deliberation on every step is too expensive to run by default. A Claude Code implementation working against real data can treat this table as literal branching logic: score the cue against these five signals, and only pay for a full Notes session when at least the fractal-position signal and one other both point that way.
