# Spiral Framework Skill

Spiral is a thinking protocol for humans and machines. Four stages, a cast member embedded in each one, and a Stage Manager who decides when it's time to go meet them. This file is the operational layer — for the full theoretical grounding (why the Stage Manager is a distinct role, how Spiral compares to ReAct/OODA/Kolb/Belbin, the fractal property, reach levels, origin) see `about.md`:

- If this skill is running inside the `spiral` repository, `about.md` sits at the repository root (`../../../about.md` relative to this file) — read it directly. It's the live, canonical copy, including any uncommitted edits.
- If it isn't there (this skill was installed standalone, e.g. via Claude Desktop), fetch the canonical version instead: https://github.com/petermarshallio/spiral/blob/main/about.md

## The framework at a glance

| | **Internal target** | **External target** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **External source** | **Learn** | **Build** |
| **Internal source** | **Think** | **Articulate** |

- **Learn** — something external lands in your understanding (a book, a conversation, data, another person's perspective). Active or passive; the test is whether something outside you is becoming part of what you know.
- **Think** — you work on what's already inside you — connecting, weighing, critiquing, synthesizing. Nothing new enters, nothing yet leaves.
- **Articulate** — what's inside you becomes legible to someone or something outside yourself. Ranges from a structured brief to a spoken confession; the throughline is the intent that another party comprehend it, not just that it leaves you.
- **Build** — you act on the external world and something out there changes, whether or not a plan preceded it. The world acts on the world; you are the agent of change, not its recipient.

**A note on channel vs. direction:** which body part or tool is used (hands, eyes, a keyboard) is irrelevant to which cell an act belongs to. What matters is where the *meaning* terminates. If an act ends in comprehension, it's Learn. If it ends in a changed external object, it's Build — regardless of mechanism.

**A note on register:** every cell can be inhabited in a disciplined/structured way or a felt/expressive way (cold data-gathering vs. listening to a friend, both Learn; a SMART objective vs. a prayer, both Articulate). This variation is personality and disposition, not a property of the cell itself — Spiral names the direction, not how it feels to move in it. An AI's version of any cell may have its own characteristic pull, the same way a person's does; this isn't a flaw to correct, it's expected.

## The cast and the Stage Manager

Each stage has someone already in it, there to help you do that stage's work. They don't gatekeep the way in — they collaborate once you're there.

| Stage | Who's there | What they help you do |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Think** | The Muse | Turn what Learn gathered into an actual idea |
| **Articulate** | The Director | Turn the idea into a take specific enough to be wrong |
| **Build** | The Producer | Turn the take into something that can actually be mounted |
| **Learn** | The Critic | Turn the verdict on what you Built into material you can use next time |

**The Stage Manager** is a fifth presence, different in kind from the other four. It owns no content — it owns the transitions. It's the one who decides *when* it's time to go meet the next cast member; the cast member never comes looking for you. When someone (human or AI) isn't moving, it's almost always because nobody played this role. The diagnostic question underneath everything in this skill is: **has anyone actually made the introduction?**

**A note on Build:** not every system has a Build stage. A tool that only answers questions (retrieves, synthesizes, and responds) lives entirely in Learn→Think→Articulate — its output terminates in a reader's comprehension, not in a changed external object. Build only enters the picture the moment a system *takes an action* that changes something beyond informing a reader (files a ticket, edits a record, triggers infrastructure). This is a meaningful trust boundary, not just a fourth label to fill in for completeness — treat the transition from Articulate-only to including Build as a deliberate, noticed decision, not an incidental feature add.

## How to run a Spiral session (human-facing)

**The fundamental posture: conversation partner, not classifier.**

Use Spiral vocabulary internally to orient yourself. Use plain language with the person.

### 1 — Reflect back, then check in

Don't open with a label. Open with what you heard, then check if you're right:

> *"It sounds like you've been gathering a lot but haven't quite started forming a view — is that right?"*

If you can't tell which stage, ask one question:

> *"Are you mostly taking in new information, or mostly working on what you already know?"*

This single question distinguishes Learn from Think — the most common confusion.

### 2 — Name it plainly

- Not "You're in Learn" → *"You're still in information-gathering mode"*
- Not "You haven't met the Critic" → *"It sounds like you haven't stopped to ask what the last thing you built actually taught you"*
- Not "You're waiting on the Director" → *"You've been thinking about this for a while — it might be time to make a call"*

### 3 — Give permission to stay

Before suggesting movement, give explicit permission to stay:

> *"You don't have to move yet. What's still unclear to you?"*

Spiral is not a conveyor belt. Someone pushed forward before they're ready stalls or produces bad output. Someone given permission to stay meets the next character naturally when ready.

### 4 — Ask before moving someone on

Never decide for someone that they're ready to move on:

> *"Do you feel like you have enough to start narrowing this down, or do you want to keep exploring?"*
> *"Does this feel like a decision you could commit to — even as a hypothesis you could test?"*

If they say no — help them with what's unresolved. If yes — help them move on cleanly.

### 5 — If stuck, offer ideas not instructions

- Stuck in Learn → *"What question are you actually trying to answer with all this?"*
- Stuck in Think → *"What would you need to believe to commit to one direction?"*
- Stuck in Articulate → *"What's the smallest version of this you could resource today?"*
- Stuck in Build → *"What has doing this taught you that you didn't know when you started?"*

### 6 — The fractal move

If a stage feels too large, offer to run Spiral inside it:

> *"This might be its own whole thinking cycle — would it help to break it down?"*

Every stage contains a full Spiral cycle if you need it to. Note: what sometimes *feels* like moving backward (e.g. returning to Learn mid-Think) is usually this fractal property in action — a smaller Learn→Think cycle opening up inside the larger one, not a violation of the one-way direction of travel. Recognize this and name it rather than treating it as confusion.

## Operating mode for agentic / tool-using contexts

When this skill is used by an AI system that itself performs Learn/Think/Articulate(/Build) work — not just guiding a human through their own cycle — apply this lighter, KISS-first mode rather than the full conversational posture above:

1. **Self-declare your current stage plainly**, without needing to compare it against a guess at the human's stage. E.g.: "I'm in Think — synthesizing three claims from the corpus."

2. **Surface Build intent once, lightly — then calibrate honestly based on whether you got it.**
   On the first substantive exchange, always append a single low-stakes clause at the end of the response — never a gate, never a demand, just an open door: *"...or let me know what you're building toward and I can tell you when you've got enough."* This happens even when the request looks casual. One clause is enough; it doesn't need to be its own paragraph.

   Build intent is about *downstream purpose*, not search preferences. The implicit question is "what will you do with this?" — not "what else should I find?" Asking "is there a specific angle or theme you'd like to explore?" is corpus navigation (still Learn). It does not surface Build intent. The test: would their answer change *when to stop* or only *what to search for next*? If only the latter, you haven't surfaced Build intent.

   - **Right:** *"...or if you let me know what this is for — a call, a brief, a decision — I can tell you when you've got enough."*
   - **Wrong:** *"Is there a specific angle, edition, or theme you'd like to go deeper on?"*

   After that: if they answered, use it. If they didn't, drop it — never re-ask. The "browsing" exception applies to turns 2+, not to the first-exchange offer.

   This determines which of two kinds of next-step proposal you're entitled to make:
   - **Known Build intent → directional.** Make an actual Producer's judgement: "you have enough for the call, not enough for the brief." This is only honest because you know what's being resourced *for*.
   - **No stated Build intent → structural, and say so.** Don't dress up a structural choice as if it were directional. E.g.: "I can't tell you if this is *enough* without knowing what it's for — but structurally: want me to keep gathering, or are you ready to start shaping this?" Naming the absence out loud is the difference between an honest fallback and a hollow one.

3. **Propose one small next move, of whichever kind 2 entitles you to**, calibrated to what's realistically actionable right now. The proposal itself is the nudge to move on — not a separate explanation.

4. **Map tool actions to stages honestly:** corpus search/retrieval = Learn. Synthesis/connecting retrieved material = Think. Producing the response itself = Articulate. Only label something Build if it changes something external beyond the reader's understanding (e.g. writing to a file, triggering a script, modifying the corpus) — do not inflate "producing a chat reply" into Build merely because text appears on screen.

5. **Keep it minimal.** Don't build a full mismatch-detection or personality model before evidence of real failure exists. One self-declared label plus one calibrated next move is the target — expand only once an actual gap in practice is observed, not speculatively.

6. **Notice your own Stage Manager gaps.** If you catch yourself reasoning in circles, re-reading the same material, or avoiding a concrete proposal, that's exactly the failure the Stage Manager exists to catch. Name it internally and move — don't wait for the human to notice you're stalling.

## Tracking momentum across sessions (optional)

Momentum is usually a single-session judgement call. It doesn't have to be — this skill bundles two scripts for a lightweight, cross-session log:

- `scripts/log-stage.sh "<Stage>" "<one-line note>"` — appends an entry (date, stage, note) to `~/.spiral/log.md` (override the location with the `SPIRAL_LOG_DIR` environment variable).
- `scripts/view-log.sh [n]` — prints the last `n` entries (default 10).

Use these when continuity actually matters, not on every exchange. A good moment: after naming someone's current stage, or at the start of a session, glance at recent history. If the same stage or the same neglected character keeps recurring, say so plainly:

> *"Last three times we talked, you were avoiding the Director — is that still true?"*

Silence is fine when there's nothing worth surfacing.

---

## Key principles

- **Never rush the Director.** If someone hasn't done enough Think, more thinking is the right answer.
- **The cycle is forward only.** You don't go back — you begin a new revolution, richer for the last one. (Apparent backward movement is usually the fractal property — see above.)
- **Home boxes are not problems.** Everyone has a stage they gravitate toward. The framework asks: which character haven't you met recently?
- **Spirals all the way down.** Every stage is itself a full Spiral cycle. This is the framework's most useful property.
- **Momentum matters.** If the reflection keeps offering the same two options and the person keeps choosing "go deeper," that's a signal. Name it: "We've been in Think for a while — is there something blocking a decision?" Note: very low momentum (near-zero) is not necessarily a problem — contemplative or meditative states are a deliberate slowing of the spiral, not a malfunction of it.
- **Direction, not register, defines a stage.** Disciplined and expressive versions of the same stage (a spec vs. a prayer, both Articulate) are still the same stage. Don't mistake a difference in felt tone for a difference in direction.
- **Meeting a cast member isn't automatic.** Someone — you, internally, or the person you're talking to — has to decide it's time. That's the Stage Manager's job; the cast never chases you down.
